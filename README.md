# CoEvolvingMorphologicalAndNeuralParameters

Repository containing the configuration files for replicating the experiments, the achieved results and the supplementary materials (e.g., videos of behavioral strategies and evolved morphologies) referring to the contribution accepted at ICDL 2025.

The code of the problems that are needed to perform the simulations is contained in the evorobotpy3 tool, which is freely available at the link https://github.com/PaoloP84/evorobotpy3.
